            <h1>Report: Large Coursework (Medy Website)</h1>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement?</h4>
            <p>Medy is a website meant to promote the practice and cultivation of living in mindfulness. The site serves as a hub for the latest information on mindfulness and highlights tools and tips to help cultivate the user's practice. Medy also highlights some of the talking heads in the mindfulness community. In this case, Thich Nhat Hanh is highlighted via a timeline page. Practitioners of all skill levels should be able to find functionality through the site's simple tools and guidance in the easy-to-digest information the site presents.</p>
            <p>To achieve this goal, the site largely employs a simple and clean layout. The important information including articles, videos and tools, are encased in a visually distinct box to help focus the user on the item in question. Focusing on one thing is a key-element in practicing mindfulness; The site is built to reflect that idea. Medy's web pages will only have a maximum of a couple of unique items on the screen at one time. The site's tree is also simple and relatively shallow. The user should be only a couple of clicks away from all information on the website.</p>

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <h4>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers, websites, artists, blogs).</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Thich Nhat Hanh appears in quite a few articles and has a whole page dedicated to his life. He is an important figure in my life and the main reason I practice mindfulness in my daily life. He passed away last year and while I don't have the luxury of going to Plum Village to remember his spirit, I felt that creating his own little space on this project was a nice touch for a website based on a practice he inspired within me. Selfishly, his incredible life story also aided in providing content for my timeline page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The Website <a href="https://www.calm.com/">calm.com</a> was another heavy inspiration for Medy. The way the website invokes a pleasant sensation and does not overbear the user was something I tried to encapsulate with Medy. Medy's background images, hover effects and tools were heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.calm.com/">calm.com</a>.  A lot of meditation sites are very simple with their presentation and <a href="https://www.calm.com/">calm.com</a> perfectly encapsulates that. Medy is a large site, and <a href="https://www.calm.com/">calm.com</a> helped to reference what the larger websites in the meditation community look like and how they interact with the user.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The website <a href="https://100.ucla.edu/timeline?mode=time&nodeID=XL5AnBAAAB4A9_2N">UCLA 100</a> was an inspiration for the timeline presentation. Medy needed to have great HTML and CSS, but it also needed great JavaScript and I wanted a whole page to be dedicated to using heavy JS. This website helped create the idea of a dynamic timeline for the user to scroll through and as the user progressed the background image was changed, and information was to fade in. <a href="https://100.ucla.edu/timeline?mode=time&nodeID=XL5AnBAAAB4A9_2N">UCLA 100</a> has a beautiful presentation, and it caught my eye as soon as I came across it in my research. The concept lends itself well to paying homage to Thich Nhat Hanh. It was a perfect find.</p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <h4>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible to those with different abilities and needs (for example those with visual impairment)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Standard accessibility web conventions were followed in the implementation of Medy. All images have alt tags, and clickable objects such as a tags and buttons have a clear separation from the surrounding content. This is to ensure that individuals utilizing screen readers can access the website and understand the visual aspects of Medy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Medy's overall design is meant to be easily navigable and understood by a wide array of individuals. Clear heading hierarchy and well-labelled links help the user to find exactly what they are looking for. The simplistic design is also meant to highlight what the user should be focusing on to limit distractions. This again aids visually impaired individuals but also helps users who may have undeveloped web skills or live with ADHD. There should be fewer barriers to entry into the practice of mindfulness and Medy conveys a simple digestible website to aid in that goal.</p>

            <h3>Usability</h3>
            <h4>State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Medy maintains a consistent design throughout its pages and through its responsive design. When a user visits one page, they can quickly infer how other pages will behave and allow this pattern to guide them to what they are looking for. This ensures the usability of the site never suffers from a potential learning curve. As it should be straightforward to understand the simplistic design and then navigate from there.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Medy follows standard website conventions. Items such as vertical scrolling, a small device drop-down menu and intuitive navigation are some usability features that users have come to expect from a website. Medy follows these standard conventions and employs these to meet its goal of being a simple and intuitive website. The user should spend time gaining actionable knowledge on mindfulness, not trying to understand how to navigate the website.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Lastly, Medy is meant to provide simple meditation tools. The user should be able to enhance their practice with some of the tools provided by the website. These tools have an intuitive design, and each tool serves a single purpose. This allows users to easily find the tool they desire and quickly dive into their practice. Users should be able to bookmark the tools page and get actionable results from the tools in less than a couple of minutes.</p>

            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <h4>state 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Implementing JavaScript into the website came with several challenges. The largest challenge I overcame was the timeline pages' use of the intersection observer API. I liked the look of timelines that faded in and out and through researching how web developers got this functionality I came across the intersection observer API. Previous to this project I had no experience with this bit of functionality. However, through a quality <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IbRtjez6ag">video</a> tutorial and some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API">documentation</a> on the API, I was able to implement a script that effectively faded the timeline articles in and out of the screen in an attractive manner. </p>
