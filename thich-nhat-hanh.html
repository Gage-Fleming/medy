                        university in Saigon, and one of the first six monks to ride a bicycle.

                        A few months later, he traveled once more to the U.S. and Europe to make the case for peace and to call 
                        for an end to hostilities in Vietnam. It was during this 1966 trip that he first met Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
                        who nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1967. As a result of this mission both North and South Vietnam 
                        denied him the right to return to Vietnam, and he began a long exile of 39 years.
