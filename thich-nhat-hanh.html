                    <h4>The beginning</h4>
                    <p>In the 1950s, Thich Nhat Hanh was a young monk and teacher in Vietnam. He established the An Quang Buddhist Academy in Saigon, which aimed to provide a modern education that integrated Buddhist teachings with subjects such as literature, history, and social sciences. He also founded the Van Hanh Buddhist University, which aimed to provide higher education and training for Buddhist monks. Along with teaching, Thich Nhat Hanh also worked to promote peace and reconciliation during a time of great turmoil in Vietnam. He traveled around the country, giving talks and workshops on mindfulness, compassion, and nonviolence, and he also advocated for the peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict. In the 1950s he also started to travel abroad, to France, Japan and India where he was able to present his vision of engaged Buddhism to a wider audience. He also began to publish articles and books, which helped to make his name known internationally.</p>

                    <p>The Order of Interbeing, also known as the Order of Interdependent Origination, is a monastic order founded by Thich Nhat Hanh as an extension of the Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism. The Order is based on the principles of interdependence and interbeing, which state that all things in the universe are interconnected and interdependent, and that our actions and decisions have an impact on the world around us. Members of the Order take the Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings, which are a set of moral guidelines that emphasize the importance of non-violence, compassion, and understanding in all aspects of life. They also commit to living a monastic lifestyle, which includes living in a community, practicing mindfulness and meditation, and engaging in service and social action.</p>

                    <p>In 1966, Vietnamese Zen master and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh met with American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. during Nhat Hanh's visit to the United States. The meeting was arranged by a mutual friend and took place at the home of civil rights leader James Lawson in Nashville, Tennessee. During the meeting, Nhat Hanh and King discussed the use of nonviolence as a means of achieving social change, and King expressed his support for Nhat Hanh's efforts to promote peace and reconciliation in Vietnam. King also wrote a public letter to the American Friends Service Committee, endorsing Nhat Hanh's work, in which he wrote: "I have been particularly impressed by his ideas for the rehabilitation of Vietnam. I feel that we cannot begin to withdraw from that struggle without at the same time undertaking to engage in the struggle for the improvement of the human condition here and now."</p>

                    <h4>Tragic Stroke</h4>
                    <p>Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Zen Master and peace activist, suffered a severe stroke in November 2014. The stroke left him unable to speak or move and he was placed in a medically induced coma for several weeks. He was later transferred to a rehabilitation center in France, where he received extensive physical therapy and rehabilitation. Despite the severity of the stroke, Thich Nhat Hanh made a remarkable recovery and was able to return to Plum Village, his Buddhist community in France. He communicated through a system of hand signals and gestures, and was able to resume teaching and writing. Thich Nhat Hanh's stroke was a reminder of the fragility of human life and the importance of taking care of our physical and mental health. </p>
